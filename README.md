android-maven-osmdroid-map
==========================

A simple android application that implements mapping using Open Street Maps. After playing around with Google Maps v2.0 which makes use of Google Play Services, I decided I'd rather not use it. I looked around for alternatives, and the [Open Street Map project](http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=5/51.522/7.603 "Open Street Map project") seemed to do what I wanted. 

The [OSMdroid](https://code.google.com/p/osmdroid/ "OSMDroid") API makes implemention a breeze.
